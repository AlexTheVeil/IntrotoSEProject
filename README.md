# IntrotoSEProject
This project contains the specification requirements of Pabloâ€™s Tech Company Website, and will discuss its functions, planned requirements, and overall design of the product. PTC is a web store designed to allow users to easily buy and sell aftermarket personal computers and computer components. PTC will allow users to search the webstore for certain categories of computers, specific components, and buy items from the store. PTC will also allow users to create listings to sell PCs or components and receive payment from other users. Admins will have direct control over the approval of listings and sales in order to ensure credibility and prevent fraud and false sales. The store will be available online and designed to be user-friendly.
